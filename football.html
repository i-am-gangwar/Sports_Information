Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word
football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called
football include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football
or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic
football. These various forms of football are known as football codes.
There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the
world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public
schools during the 19th century. The expansion of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas
of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire. By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were
already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in
order to maintain their heritage.In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many
professional football competitions. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some
of the most popular team sports in the world.</i>

<i>The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠), as stated by FIFA, is the earliest form of football for which there is scientific
evidence and appears in a military manual dated to the second and third centuries BC. It existed during the Han
dynasty and possibly the Qin dynasty, in the second and third centuries BC. The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (蹴
鞠), and was developed during the Asuka period.This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court
in Kyoto from about 600 AD. In kemari several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the
ball drop to the ground (much like keepie uppie).</i></td>

The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet.
The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as "ἐπίσκυρος"
(Episkyros) or "φαινίνδα" (phaininda), which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC)
and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c.215 AD). These games appear to have
resembled rugby football.
The Roman politician Cicero (106–43 BC)describes the case of a man who was killedwhilst having a shave when a ball was
kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ballgames already knew the air-filled ball, thefollis. Episkyros is recognised as an
early form of football by FIFA.There are a number of references totraditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball
games, played by indigenous peoples inmany different parts of the world. Forexample, in 1586, men from a shipcommanded by an English explorer named
John Davis, went ashore to play a form offootball with Inuit (Eskimo) people in Greenland. There are later accounts of anInuit game played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk. Each match began with two teams facing
each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team'sline and then at a goal. In 1610, William Strachey, a colonist at Jamestown, Virginia
recorded a game played by Native Americans, called Pahsaheman. On the Australiancontinent several tribes of indigenous people played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been
generalised by historians as Marn Grook (Djab Wurrung for "game ball"). The earliest historical account is an anecdotefrom the 1878 book by Robert Brough-Smyth, The Aborigines of Victoria, in which a man called Richard Thomas is
quoted as saying, in about 1841 in Victoria, Australia, that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: "MrThomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a possum and how other players
leap into the air in order to catch it." Some historians have theorised that Marn Grook was one of the origins of Australian
rules football.

<h1 class="c"> Medieval and early Europe </h1>
<p class="a"><i>The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in
England. An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th century Historia Brittonum, which
describes "a party of boys ... playing at ball". References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or
Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks,date from the 12th century.<br/><br/></br>
The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as "mobfootball", would be played between neighbouring towns and villages, involving
an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash enmasse,truggling to move an item, such as inflated animal's bladder to
particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with playtaking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes.The game
was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide,Christmas, or Easter, and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern
era in a number of English towns (see below).The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England
was given by William FitzStephen in about 1174–1183. He described theactivities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday:<br/><br/><br/>
An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at Ulgham, Northumberland, England:
"Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David".Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented
reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a "football game" at Newcastle, County Down being charged with accidentally
stabbing a player named William Bernard. Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at Shouldham, Norfolk,
England: "[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself".
In 1314, Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football in the French used by
the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: "[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by
hustling over large foot balls [rageries de grosses pelotes de pee in the fields of the public from which many evils
might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be
used in the city in the future." This is the earliest reference to football

<h1 class="c">Calcio Fiorentino</h1>
<p class="a"><i>In the 16th century, the city of Florence celebrated the period between
Epiphany and Lent by playing a game which today is known as "calcio storico"
("historic kickball") in the Piazza Santa Croce. The young aristocrats of the
city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent
form of football. For example, calcio players could punch, shoulder charge, and
kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is said to have
originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di
Vernio wrote Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino. This is sometimes
said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not
played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).

</i></p>
<h1 class="c">Official disapproval and attempts to ban football</h1>
<p class="a"><i>
There have been many attempts to ban football, from the middle ages through to the modern day. The first such law was
passed in England in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667.[45]:6 Women were
banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s.
Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.

<h1 class="c">Establishment of modern codes</h1>
<h2 class="a" ><strong>English public schools</strong></h2>
<p class="a"> <i>


While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its public schools (equivalent to private schools
in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the
evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its "mob" form and turning it into an organised
team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at
these schools. Third, it was teachers, students and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to
enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between "kicking"
and "running" (or "carrying") games first became clear.

<br/><br/>
<p class="a" ><i>
William Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have "with a fine
disregard for the rules of football, as played in his time [emphasis added], first
took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of
the rugby game." in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby
football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians
believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is
often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb
Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern soccer, however handling the
ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,[55] the rule
for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was running forward with it as the
rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards.

<h1 class="c"> Use of the word "football"</h1>
<p class="a"> <i>The word football, when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this,
much friendly controversy has occurred over the term football, primarily because it is used in different ways in different
parts of the English-speaking world. Most often, the word "football" is used to refer to the code of football that is
considered dominant within a particular region. So, effectively, what the word "football" means usually depends on where
one says it.
In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football
code is known solely as "football", while the others generally require a
qualifier. In New Zealand, "football" historically referred to rugby union, but
more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The
sport meant by the word "football" in Australia is either Australian rules
football or rugby league, depending on local popularity (which largely
conforms to the Barassi Line). In francophone Quebec, where Canadian
football is more popular, the Canadian code is known as le football while
American football is known as le football américain and association football is
known as le soccer.

</i></p>
<h1 class=" c"> Rugby football</h1>
<p class="a" ><i>In Britain, by 1870, there were 49 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school
game. There were also "rugby" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and
New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby
until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the Rugby
Football Union (RFU). The first official RFU rules were adopted in June
1871. These rules allowed passing the ball. They also included the try,
where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though dropgoals
from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main
form of contest.

<h1 class="c">Gaelic football</h1>

<p class="a"><i>
In the mid-19th century, various traditional football games,
referred to collectively as caid, remained popular in Ireland,
especially in County Kerry. One observer, Father W. Ferris,
described two main forms of caid during this period: the "field
game" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like
goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic "crosscountry
game" which took up most of the daylight hours of a
Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking
the ball across a parish boundary. "Wrestling", "holding" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.
By the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. Trinity College Dublin was an
early stronghold of Rugby (see the Developments in the 1850s section, above). The rules of the English FA were being
distributed widely. Traditional forms of caid had begun to give way to a "rough-and-tumble game" which allowed tripping.
There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic
Association (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as hurling and to reject imported
games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by Maurice Davin and published
in the United Ireland magazine on 7 February 1887.

<td class="a"><i>
During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games.
In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at
Uppingham School and he issued his own rules of what he called "The Simplest Game" (these are also known as the
Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven
member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.
At the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several
football clubs in the London Metropolitan area met for the inaugural meeting of The Football Association (FA).</i></td>

<p class="a"><i> The aim of
the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following
the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and
Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a
draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently
published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely
running with (carrying) the ball and hacking (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as
