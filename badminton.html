Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit ashuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams,
the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player perside) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often
played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formalgames are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by
striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within theopposing side's half of the court.
Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the
net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has
been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the
opposing side.
The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile
which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In
particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the
shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high
top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the
shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.
The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore
and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by Denmark but
the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions
dominated by China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer
Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's
doubles, and women's doubles, with mixed doubles added four years
later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed,
and precision.

<i>
Games employing shuttlecocks have been played for centuries across Eurasia, but the
modern game of badminton developed in the mid-19th century among the British as a
variant of the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. ("Battledore" was an older
term for "racquet".) Its exact origin remains obscure. The name derives from the
Duke of Beaufort's Badminton House in Gloucestershire, but why or when remains
unclear. As early as 1860, a London toy dealer named Isaac Spratt published a booklet
entitled Badminton Battledore – A New Game, but no copy is known to have
survived.An 1863 article in The Cornhill Magazine describes badminton as
"battledore and shuttlecock played with sides, across a string suspended some five feet
from the ground".
The game may have originally developed among expatriate officers in British India,
where it was very popular by the 1870s.all badminton, a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a
shuttlecock, was being played in Thanjavur as early as the 1850s and was at first played interchangeably with
badminton by the British, the woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather.
The sport was played under the Pune rules until 1887, when J. H. E. Hart of the Bath
Badminton Club drew up revised regulations. In 1890, Hart and Bagnel Wild again
revised the rules. The Badminton Association of England (BAE) published these rules
in 1893 and officially launched the sport at a house called "Dunbar" in Portsmouth on
13 September.The BAE started the first badminton competition, the All England
Open Badminton Championships for gentlemen's doubles, ladies' doubles, and mixed
doubles, in 1899.Singles competitions were added in 1900 and an England–Ireland
championship match appeared in 1904.
England, Scotland, Wales, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, and
New Zealand were the founding members of the International Badminton Federation in
1934, now known as the Badminton World Federation. India joined as an affiliate in
1936. The BWF now governs international badminton. Although initiated in England, competitive men's badminton has
traditionally been dominated in Europe by Denmark. Worldwide, Asian nations have become dominant in international
competition. China, Denmark, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, South Korea and Japan are the nations which have consistently
produced world-class players in the past few decades, with China being the greatest force in men's and women's
competition recently.
The game has also become a popular backyard sport in the United States.

<h1 class="c b" ><b> Rules</b></h1>
<dl>
<h2><dt   class="c"><b>court</b></dt></h2>
<dd   class="a"><i>
The court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for
both singles and doubles play, although badminton rules permit a court to be marked
for singles only.[13] The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but both are of the
same length. The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is that the
doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.
The full width of the court is 6.1 metres (20 ft), and in singles this width is reduced to
5.18 metres (17 ft). The full length of the court is 13.4 metres (44 ft). The service courts
are marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a
distance of 1.98 metres (6 ft 6 inch) from the net, and by the outer side and back boundaries. In doubles, the service court
is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.76 metres (2 ft 6 inch) from the back boundary.
The net is 1.55 metres (5 ft 1 inch) high at the edges and 1.524 metres (5 ft) high in the centre. The net posts are placed
over the doubles sidelines, even when singles is played.
The minimum height for the ceiling above the court is not mentioned in the Laws of Badminton. Nonetheless, a
badminton court will not be suitable if the ceiling is likely to be hit on a high serve.

</i></dd>
<h2><dt class="c " ><b>Serving</b></dt></h2>
<dd   class="a"><i>When the server serves, the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the
opponents' court or it will count as a fault. The server and receiver must remain within
their service courts, without touching the boundary lines, until the server strikes the
shuttlecock. The other two players may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do
not block the vision of the server or receiver.
At the start of the rally, the server and receiver stand in diagonally opposite service
courts (see court dimensions). The server hits the shuttlecock so that it would land in
the receiver's service court. This is similar to tennis, except that in a badminton serve
the whole shuttle must be below 1.15 metres from the surface of the court at the instant
of being hit by the server's racket, the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce and in
badminton, the players stand inside their service courts, unlike tennis.
When the serving side loses a rally, the server immediately passes to their opponent(s)
(this differs from the old system where sometimes the serve passes to the doubles
partner for what is known as a "second serve").
In singles, the server stands in their right service court when their score is even, and in
her/his left service court when her/his score is odd.
In doubles, if the serving side wins a rally, the same player continues to serve, but
he/she changes service courts so that she/he serves to a different opponent each time.
If the opponents win the rally and their new score is even, the player in the right service
court serves; if odd, the player in the left service court serves. The players' service courts are determined by their positions
at the start of the previous rally, not by where they were standing at the end of the rally. A consequence of this system is
that each time a side regains the service, the server will be the player who did not serve last time.

</i></dd>
<h2><dt class="c " ><b>Scoring</b></dt></h2>
<dd  class="a"><i>
Each game is played to 21 points, with players scoring a point whenever they win a rally regardless of whether they
served[13] (this differs from the old system where players could only win a point on their serve and each game was played
to 15 points). A match is the best of three games.
If the score reaches 20-all, then the game continues until one side gains a two-point lead (such as 24–22), except when
there is a tie at 29-all, in which the game goes to a golden point. Whoever scores this point will win.
At the start of a match, the shuttlecock is cast and the side towards which the shuttlecock is pointing serves first.
Alternatively, a coin may be tossed, with the winners choosing whether to serve or receive first, or choosing which end of
the court to occupy first, and their opponents making the leftover the remaining choice

</i></dd>
<h2><dt class="c "><b>Lets</b></dt></h2>
<dd  class="a"><i>
If a let is called, the rally is stopped and replayed with no change to the score. Lets may occur because of some unexpected
disturbance such as a shuttlecock landing on a court (having been hit there by players playing in adjacent court) or in
small halls the shuttle may touch an overhead rail which can be classed as a let.
If the receiver is not ready when the service is delivered, a let shall be called; yet, if the receiver attempts to return the
shuttlecock, the receiver shall be judged to have been ready.

<h1 class="c b" ><b>Technique</b></h1>
<dl>
<h2><dt class="c "><b>Strokes</b></dt></h2>
<dd  class="a"><i>
Badminton offers a wide variety of basic strokes, and players require a high level of
skill to perform all of them effectively. All strokes can be played either forehand or
backhand. A player's forehand side is the same side as their playing hand: for a righthanded
player, the forehand side is their right side and the backhand side is their left
side. Forehand strokes are hit with the front of the hand leading (like hitting with the
palm), whereas backhand strokes are hit with the back of the hand leading (like
hitting with the knuckles). Players frequently play certain strokes on the forehand
side with a backhand hitting action, and vice versa.

</i></dd>
<h2><dt class="c " ><b>Position of the shuttlecock and receiving player </b></dt></h2>
<dd  class="a"><i>The choice of stroke depends on how near the shuttlecock is to the net, whether it is
above net height, and where an opponent is currently positioned: players have much
better attacking options if they can reach the shuttlecock well above net height,
especially if it is also close to the net. In the forecourt, a high shuttlecock will be met
with a net kill, hitting it steeply downwards and attempting to win the rally
immediately. This is why it is best to drop the shuttlecock just over the net in this
situation. In the midcourt, a high shuttlecock will usually be met with a powerful
smash, also hitting downwards and hoping for an outright winner or a weak reply.

</i><dd>
<h2><dt class="c " ><b>Vertical position of the shuttlecock</b></dt></h2>
<dd><i>
<ul>
<li   class="a"><i>
<strong ><h3>When the shuttlecock is well below net height</h3></strong> players have no choice but to hit
upwards. Lifts, where the shuttlecock is hit upwards to the back of the opponents'
court, can be played from all parts of the court. If a player does not lift, their only
remaining option is to push the shuttlecock softly back to the net: in the forecourt, this
is called a net shot; in the midcourt or rear court, it is often called a push or block.
</i></li>
<li   class="a"><i>


<strong><h3>When the shuttlecock is near to net height</h3></strong>players can hit drives, which travel
flat and rapidly over the net into the opponents' rear midcourt and rear court. Pushes
may also be hit flatter, placing the shuttlecock into the front midcourt. Drives and
pushes may be played from the midcourt or forecourt, and are most often used in
doubles: they are an attempt to regain the attack, rather than choosing to lift the
shuttlecock and defend against smashes. After a successful drive or push, the
opponents will often be forced to lift the shuttlecock.
