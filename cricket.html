<div  class="a" >Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of elevenplayers on a field at the centre of which is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch
with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on threestumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the
wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to preventthis and dismiss each player (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal
include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges thebails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat,
but before it hits the ground. When ten players have been dismissed, theinnings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two
umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in internationalmatches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the
match's statistical information.There are various formats ranging from Twenty20, played over a few
hours with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs, to Testmatches, played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each
batting for two innings of unlimited length. Traditionally cricketers playin all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team
colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear toprevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made
of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a corkcore which is layered with tightly wound string.
Historically, cricket's origins are uncertain and the earliest definitereference is in south-east England in the middle of the 16th century. It
spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, leading to thefirst international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The
game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), whichhas over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test
matches. The game's rules are held in a code called the Laws of Cricketwhich is owned and maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in
London. The sport is followed primarily in the Indian subcontinent,Australasia, the United Kingdom, southern Africa and the West Indies,
its globalisation occurring during the expansion of the British Empireand remaining popular into the 21st century. Women's cricket, which
is organised and played separately, has also achieved internationalstandard. The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, having won seven One Day International trophies,
including five World Cups, more than any other country and having been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.

<h1  class="c " > HISTORY</h1>

<img src="cricket img1.jpg" align="right" >
<div class="a">
<strong>Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement; others
include baseball, golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis.In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of
a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batsman must defend.The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three "groups" of "club ball" games: the "hockey group", in which
the ball is driven to and fro between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended
target (the hole); and the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from it".
It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the south-eastern counties of England, sometime during
the medieval period. Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes
from evidence given at a court case in Guildford on Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian calendar; equating to 30 January 1598 in
the Gregorian calendar). The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-yearold
coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that:<i>"Being a scholler in the ffree schoole of Guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at
creckett and other plaies".</i>Given Derrick's age, it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c.
1550 by boys in Surrey. The view that it was originally a children's game is reinforced by Randle Cotgrave's 1611 English-
French dictionary in which he defined the noun "crosse" as "the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket" and the verb form
"crosser" as "to play at cricket".
One possible source for the sport's name is the Old English word "cryce" (or "cricc") meaning a crutch or staff. In Samuel
Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from "cryce, Saxon, a stick". In Old French, the word "criquet" seems to have meant
a kind of club or stick.Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders
when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders
at the time) "krick"(-e), meaning a stick (crook). Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word "krickstoel", meaning a
long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.
According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, "cricket" derives from the Middle Dutch
phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., "with the stick chase"). Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but
also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.
<h2 class="c"><b>Growth of amateur and professional cricket in England</b></h2>
<p><i>
Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs, theearly form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects.
The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and all along the ground towards abatsman armed with a bat that, in shape, resembled a hockey stick; the batsman
defended a low, two-stump wicket; and runs were called "notches" because thescorers recorded them by notching tally sticks.
In 1611, the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published, ecclesiastical court records atSidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners, Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard
Latter, failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket.They were fined 12d each and ordered to do penance. This is the earliest mention
of adult participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliestknown organised inter-parish or village match was played – at Chevening,
Kent. In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was accidentallystruck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex.</i></p>

<h2 class="c"><b>English cricket in the 18th and 19th centuries </b></h2><p><i>
The game underwent major development in the 18th century to become England's nationalsport. Its success was underwritten by the twin necessities of patronage and betting.
Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and, in the middle years of the century,large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury. The single wicket form
of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match, its popularity peaking in the 1748season. Bowling underwent an evolution around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the
ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman. This caused a revolution in batdesign because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern
straight bat in place of the old "hockey stick" shape.The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next twenty years until th
formation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787,Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point. MCC quickly became the
sport's premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket. New Laws introduced in thelatter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket
(lbw).

</i></p>
<h2 class="c"><b> Cricket becomes an international sport </b></h2><p><i>
Meanwhile, the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the gameoverseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in
Australia, the Caribbean, India, New Zealand, North America and South Africa.In 1844, the first-ever international match took place between the United States and
Canada. In 1859, a team of English players went to North America on the first
overseas tour.In 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia. The first Australian
team to travel overseas consisted of Aboriginal stockmen who toured England in1868.In 1876–77, an England team took part in what was retrospectively recognised as thefirst-ever Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia. The
rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes in 1882, and this has remained Test cricket's most famous
contest. Test ricket began to expand in 1888–89 when South Africa played England.

</i></p>
<h2 class="c"><b> World cricket in the 20th century </b></h2><p><i>
The inter-war years were dominated by Australia's Don Bradman, statistically the greatestTest batsman of all time. Test cricket continued to expand during the 20th century with the
addition of the West Indies (1928), New Zealand (1930) and India (1932) before the SecondWorld War and then Pakistan (1952), Sri Lanka (1982), Zimbabwe (1992), Bangladesh
(2000), Ireland and Afghanistan (both 2018) in the post-war period.South Africa wasbanned from international cricket from 1970 to 1992 as part of the apartheid boycott.

<h1 class="c b" ><b> Rules</b></h1>
<dl>
<h2><dt   class="c"><b>Playing area</b></dt></h2>
<dd   class="a"><i>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image, right) between two
teams of eleven players each. The field is usually circular or oval in shape and theedge of the playing area is marked by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of the
stands, a rope, a painted line or a combination of these; the boundary must if possiblebe marked along its entire length.
In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image, below) on whicha wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards
(20 m) apart. The pitch is a flat surface 3 metres (9.8 ft) wide, with very short grassthat tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on
artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps
topped by two bails.Cricket</i></dd>
<h2><dt   class="c"><b>Match structure and closure</b></dt></h2>
<dd   class="a"   ><i>Before a match begins, the team captains (who are also players) toss a coin to decide which team will bat first and so take the
first innings. Innings is the term used for each phase of play in the match.In each innings, one team bats, attempting to
score runs, while the other team bowls and fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen.
When the first innings ends, the teams change roles; there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match. A
match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days; a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in
a single day. During an innings, all eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but usually only two members of the
batting team are on the field at any given time. The exception to this is if a batsman has any type of illness or injury restricting
his or her ability to run, in this case the batsman is allowed "A Runner" who can run between the wickets when the batsman hits
a scoring run or runs The order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied.
</i></dd>
<h2><dt   class="c"><b>Bat and ball</b></dt></h2>
<dd  class="a"><i>The essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers (i.e., bowls) the ball from his end of the pitch towards the batsman who, armed
with a bat is "on strike" at the other end (see next sub-section: Basic gameplay).
The bat is made of wood, usually salix alba (white willow), and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle. The
blade must not be more than four and one quarter inches (108 mm) wide and the total length of the bat not more than 38 inches
(965 mm). There is no standard for the weight which is usually between 2 lb 7 oz and 3 lb (1.1 and 1.4 kg).
The ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid, with a circumference of 22.9 centimetres (9.0 in). The ball has a "seam": six rows of
stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior. The seam on a new ball is prominent, and helps the
bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer
usable, and during the course of this deterioration its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the
match. Players will therefore attempt to modify the ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties. Polishing the ball and
wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal, even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's swing
through the air, but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seam is illegal ball
tampering.

<h1 class="c b" ><b>Fielding</b></h1>
<dd  class="a" ><i>Of the eleven fielders, three are in shot in the image above. The other eight areelsewhere on the field, their positions determined on a tactical basis by the
captain or the bowler. Fielders often change position between deliveries, again asdirected by the captain or bowler.
If a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed tofield instead of him, but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain. The
substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return. The Laws ofCricket were updated in 2017 to allow substitutes to act as wicket-keepers, a
situation that first occurred when Mumbai Indians' wicket-keeper Ishan Kishanwas injured in a match on 18 April 2018.

</i></dd>
<h1 class="c b" ><b>Innings</b></h1>
<dd class="a"   ><i>The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phaseof play during a match. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either
one or two innings. Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but,for various reasons, an innings can end before they have all done so. The innings terminates
if the batting team is "all out", a term defined by the Laws: "at the fall of a wicket or theretirement of a batsman, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batsman is
available to come in". In this situation, one of the batsman has not been dismissed and istermed not out; this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active
batsmen while the innings is in progress.

</i></dd>
<h1 class="c b" ><b>Overs</b></h1>
<dd class="a"><i>The Laws state that, throughout an innings, "the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls".The name
"over" came about because the umpire calls "Over!" when six balls have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed
at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs,
although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a "spell".
The batsmen do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice-versa.
The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at "square leg" now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's
end and vice-versa.

</i></dd>
<h1 class="c b" ><b>Umpires and scorers</b></h1>
<dd class="a"><i>The game on the field is regulated by the two umpires, one of whom stands behindthe wicket at the bowler's end, the other in a position called "square leg" which is
about 15–20 metres away from the batsman on strike and in line with the poppingcrease on which he is taking guard. The umpires have several responsibilities
including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled (i.e., not a noballor a wide); when a run is scored; whether a batsman is out (the fielding side
must first appeal to the umpire, usually with the phrase "How's that?" or "Owzat?");when intervals start and end; and the suitability of the pitch, field and weather for
playing the game. The umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a matchdue to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or
deterioration of the light.

<hr/>
<h1 class="c b" ><b>Typpes of match</b></h1>
<p class="a"><i>
Cricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats that can effectively be dividedinto first-class cricket, limited overs cricket and, historically, single wicket cricket.
The highest standard is Test cricket (always written with a capital "T") which is ineffect the international version of first-class cricket and is restricted to teams
representing the twelve countries that are full members of the ICC (see above).Although the term "Test match" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is
deemed to have begun with two matches between Australia and England in the\1876–77 Australian season; since 1882, most Test series between England and
Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes. The term "first-class",in general usage, is applied to top-level domestic cricket. Test matches are played
over five days and first-class over three to four days; in all of these matches, theteams are allotted two innings each and the draw is a valid result.
</i></p>
<dl>
<h1><dt class="c b"> <b>International competitions</b></dt></h1>
<dd class="a"><i>Most international matches are played as parts of 'tours', when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months,
and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation. Sometimes a perpetual trophy is awarded to the winner
of the Test series, the most famous of which is The Ashes.
The ICC also organises competitions that are for several countries at once, including the Cricket World Cup, ICC T20 World Cup
and ICC Champions Trophy. A league competition for Test matches played as part of normal tours, the ICC World Test
Championship, has been proposed several times, and is currently planned to begin in 2019. A league competition for ODIs, the
2020–22 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, is planned to begin in 2020. The ICC maintains Test rankings, ODI rankings
and T20 rankings systems for the countries which play these forms of cricket.
Competitions for member nations of the ICC with Associate status include the ICC Intercontinental Cup, for first-class cricket
matches, and the World Cricket League for one-day matches, the final matches of which now also serve as the ICC World Cup
Qualifier.
</i>
</dd>
<h1><dt class="b c"><b>National competitions  </b></dt></h1>
<dd class="a"><i>First-class cricket in England is played for the most part by the 18 county clubswhich contest the County Championship. The concept of a champion county has
existed since the 18th century but the official competition was not established until1890. The most successful club has been Yorkshire, who had won 32 official titles
(plus one shared) as of 2019.Australia established its national first-class championship in 1892–93 when the
Sheffield Shield was introduced. In Australia, the first-class teams represent thevarious states. New South Wales has the highest number of titles.
The other ICC full members have national championship trophies called the AhmadShah Abdali 4-day Tournament (Afghanistan); the National Cricket League
(Bangladesh); the Ranji Trophy (India); the Inter-Provincial Championship (Ireland); the Plunket Shield (New Zealand); the
Quaid-e-Azam Trophy (Pakistan); the Currie Cup (South Africa); the Premier Trophy (Sri Lanka); the Shell Shield (West
Indies); and the Logan Cup (Zimbabwe).

</i></dd>
<h1><dt class="b c"><b> Clubs and school cricket</b></dt></h1>
<dd class="a"><i>
The world's earliest known cricket match was a village cricket meeting in Kent which has been deduced from a 1640 court case
recording a "cricketing" of "the Weald and the Upland" versus "the Chalk Hill" at Chevening "about thirty years since" (i.e.,
c. 1611). Inter-parish contests became popular in the first half of the 17th century and continued to develop through the 18th
with the first local leagues being founded in the second half of the 19th.
At the grassroots level, local club cricket is essentially an amateur pastime for those involved but still usually involves teams
playing in competitions at weekends or in the evening. Schools cricket, first known in southern England in the 17th century, has
a similar scenario and both are widely played in the countries where cricket is popular. Although there can be variations in
game format, compared with professional cricket, the Laws are always observed and club/school matches are therefore formal
and competitive events. The sport has numerous informal variants such as French cricket.
