Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water. The sport takes place
in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports, with varied distance
events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can
take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as
backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle. Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques; in competition, there are
distinct regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual stroke. there are also regulations on what types of swimsuits,
caps, jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions. Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries
from the sport, such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, there are also multiple health benefits associated with the sport.

<td class="a"><i>
Evidence of recreational swimming in prehistoric times has been found, with the earliest evidence dating to Stone Age paintings from around
10,000 years ago. Written references date from 2000 BC, with some of the earliest references to swimming including the Iliad, the Odyssey,
the Bible, Beowulf, the Quran and others. In 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a Swiss–German professor of languages, wrote the earliest known
complete book about swimming, Colymbetes, sive de arte natandi dialogus et festivus et iucundus lectu (The Swimmer, or A Dialogue on the
Art of Swimming and Joyful and Pleasant to Read).</i></td></tr><tr><td class="a"><i>
Swimming emerged as a competitive recreational activity in the 1830s in England. In 1828, the first indoor swimming pool, St George's Baths
was opened to the public. By 1837, the National Swimming Society was holding regular swimming competitions in six artificial swimming
pools, built around London. The recreational activity grew in popularity and by 1880, when the first national governing body, the Amateur
Swimming Association was formed, there were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across the country.

In 1844 two Native American participants at a swimming competition in London introduced the
front crawl to a European audience. Sir John Arthur Trudgen picked up the hand-over stroke from
some South American natives and successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873, winning a local competition in England. His stroke is still
regarded as the most powerful to use today.
Captain Matthew Webb was the first man to swim the English Channel (between England and France), in 1875. Using the breaststroke
technique, he swam the channel 21.26 miles (34.21 km) in 21 hours and 45 minutes. His feat was not replicated or surpassed for the next 36
years, until T.W. Burgess made the crossing in 1911.</i></td></tr><tr><p class="a"><i>
Other European countries also established swimming federations; Germany in 1882, France in 1890 and Hungary in 1896. The first European
amateur swimming competitions were in 1889 in Vienna. The world's first women's swimming championship was held in Scotland in 1892.
Men's swimming became part of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. In 1902, the Australian Richmond Cavill introduced
freestyle to the Western world. In 1908, the world swimming association, Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA), was formed.
Women's swimming was introduced into the Olympics in 1912; the first international swim meet for women outside the Olympics was the
Competitive swimming became popular in the 19th century. The goal of high level competitive swimming is to break personal or world records
while beating competitors in any given event. Swimming in competition should create the least resistance in order to obtain maximum speed.
However, some professional swimmers who do not hold a national or world ranking are considered the best in regard to their technical skills.
Typically, an athlete goes through a cycle of training in which the body is overloaded with work in the beginning and middle segments of the
cycle, and then the workload is decreased in the final stage as the swimmer approaches competition.

 <p class="a"><i>Competitive swimming became popular in the 19th century. The goal of high level competitive swimming is to break personal or world records
while beating competitors in any given event. Swimming in competition should create the least resistance in order to obtain maximum speed.
However, some professional swimmers who do not hold a national or world ranking are considered the best in regard to their technical skills.
Typically, an athlete goes through a cycle of training in which the body is overloaded with work in the beginning and middle segments of the
cycle, and then the workload is decreased in the final stage as the swimmer approaches competition.
The practice of reducing exercise in the days just before an important competition is called tapering. Tapering is used to give the swimmer's
body some rest without stopping exercise completely. A final stage is often referred to as "shave and taper": the swimmer shaves off all
exposed hair for the sake of reducing drag and having a sleeker and more hydrodynamic feel in the water. Additionally, the "shave and
taper" method refers to the removal of the top layer of "dead skin", which exposes the newer and richer skin underneath. This also helps to
"shave" off mere milliseconds on your time.
Swimming is an event at the Summer Olympic Games, where male and female athletes compete in
16 of the recognized events each. Olympic events are held in a 50-meter pool, called a long course pool.
There are forty officially recognized individual swimming events in the pool; however the International Olympic Committee only recognizes
32 of them. The international governing body for competitive swimming is the Fédération Internationale de Natation ("International
Swimming Federation"), better known as FINA.

 <h2 class="c"><strong>Open water</strong></h2>
 <body>
 <p  class="a" ><i>
 In open water swimming, where the events are swum in a body of open water (lake or sea), there are also 5 km, 10 km and 25 km events for
men and women. However, only the 10 km event is included in the Olympic schedule, again for both men and women. Open-water
competitions are typically separate to other swimming competitions with the exception of the World Championships and the Olympics.
 </i></p>
 </body>
 <h2 class="c"><strong>Swim styles</strong></h2>
 <p class="a"><i>
 In competitive swimming, four major styles have been established. These have been relatively stable over the last 30–40 years with minor improvements. They are:
 <br/><b>-</b> &nbsp&nbsp Butterfly<br/>
<b>-</b> &nbsp&nbsp Backstroke<br/>
<b>-</b> &nbsp&nbsp Breaststroke<br/>
<b>-</b> &nbsp&nbsp Freestyle<br/>
In competition, only one of these styles may be used except in the case of the individual medley, or IM, which consists of all four. In this latter event, swimmers swim equal distances of
butterfly, then backstroke, breaststroke, and finally, freestyle. In Olympic competition, this event is swum in two distances – 200 and 400 meters. Some short course competitions
also include the 100-yard or 100-meter IM – particularly, for younger or newer swimmers (typically under 14 years) involved in club swimming, or masters swimming (over 18).
 </i></p>
 <h2 class="c"><strong>Dolphin kick</strong></h2>
 <p class="a"><i>
 Since the 1990s, the most drastic change in swimming has been the addition of the underwater dolphin kick. This is used to maximize the speed at the start and after the turns in all
styles. The first successful use of it was by David Berkoff. At the 1988 Olympics, he swam most of the 100 m backstroke race underwater and broke the world record in the distance
during the preliminaries. Another swimmer to use the technique was Denis Pankratov at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where he completed almost half of the 100 m butterfly underwater
to win the gold medal. In the past decade, American competitive swimmers have shown the most use of the underwater dolphin kick to gain advantage, most notably Olympic and World
medal winners Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte; however currently swimmers are not allowed to go any further than fifteen metres underwater due to rule changes by FINA.[13] In
addition, FINA announced in 2014 that a single dolphin kick can be added to the breaststroke pullout prior to the first breaststroke kick.
While the dolphin kick is mostly seen in middle-distance freestyle events and in all distances of backstroke and butterfly, it is not usually used to the same effect in freestyle sprinting.
That changed with the addition of the so-called "technical" suits around the European Short Course Championships in Rijeka, Croatia in December 2008. There, Amaury Leveaux set
new world records of 44.94 seconds in the 100 m freestyle, 20.48 seconds in the 50 m freestyle and 22.18 in the 50 m butterfly. Unlike the rest of the competitors in these events, he
spent at least half of each race submerged using the dolphin kick.
 </i></p>
 <h2 class="c"><strong>Competition pools</strong></h2>
  <p class="a"><i>
  World Championship pools must be 50 metres (160 ft) (long course) long and 25 metres (82 ft) wide, with ten lanes labelled zero to nine (or one to ten in some pools; zero and nine (or
one and ten) are usually left empty in semi-finals and finals); the lanes must be at least 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) wide. They will be equipped with starting blocks at both ends of the pool and
most will have Automatic Officiating Equipment, including touch pads to record times and sensors to ensure the legality of relay takeovers. The pool must have a minimum depth of two
metres.
Other pools which host events under FINA regulations are required to meet some but not all of these requirements. Many of these pools have eight, or even six, instead of ten lanes and
some will be 25 metres (82 ft) long, making them Short course. World records that are set in short course pools are kept separate from those set in long course pools because it may be an
advantage or disadvantage to swimmers to have more or less turns in a race

 <h1 class="c"><strong>Records</strong></h1>
 <p class="a"> <i>
  The foundation of FINA in 1908 signaled the commencement of recording the first official world records in swimming.[33] At that time records could be established in any swimming
pool of length not less than 25 yards, and records were also accepted for intermediate distance split times from long distance events. Today World Records will only be accepted when
times are reported by Automatic Officiating Equipment, or Semi-Automatic Officiating Equipment in the case of Automatic Officiating Equipment system malfunction.[34]
<br/>
<br/>
Records in events such as 300 yd, 300 m, 1000 yd, and 1000 m freestyle, 400 m backstroke, and 400 m and 500 m breaststroke were no longer ratified from 1948. A further removal of
the 500 yd and 500 m freestyle, 150 m backstroke, and 3×100 m medley relay from the record listings occurred in 1952.<br/>
<br/>
In 1952, the national federations of the United States and Japan proposed at the FINA Congress the separation of records achieved in long-course and short-course pools, however it was
four more years before action came into effect with the Congress deciding to retain only records held in 50 m pools as the official world record listings.
By 1969 there were thirty-one events in which FINA recognised official world records – 16 for men, 15 for women – closely resembling the event schedule that was in use at the Olympic
Games.<br/><br/>
The increase in accuracy and reliability of electronic timing equipment led to the introduction of hundredths of a second to the time records from 21 August 1972.
Records in short course (25 m) pools began to be officially approved as "short course world records" from 3 March 1991. Prior to this date, times in short course (25 m) pools were not
officially recognised, but were regarded a "world best time" (WBT).<br/><br/>
 From 31 October 1994 times in 50 m backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly were added to the official record listings.
FINA currently recognises world records in the following events for both men and women.

 <h1 class="c"><strong>Health benefits</strong></h1>
 <p class="a" ><i>
  Swimming is a healthy activity that can be done by most people throughout their life. It is a low-impact workout that has several mental and bodily health benefits all while being a
good recreational activity. Swimming builds endurance, muscle strength, and cardiovascular fitness.Correspondingly, it also improves weight loss while being a safer alternative of
working out for someone who is injured or for women who are pregnant.Swimming requires less effort than other sports, but the athletes will get the results they are looking for.
<br/><br/>The U.S. Census Bureau reports that two and a half hours per week of aerobic physical activity such as swimming can decrease the risk of chronic illnesses, and help regenerate healthy
cells. Furthermore, swimming is linked to better cognitive function; also lowering the risk of Type II diabetes, high blood pressure, and a stroke. It can improve lung and heart
strength while it tones muscles in a full body workout.7 People can typically exercise longer in water than on land without increased effort and minimal joint or muscle pain. When in
the water the body undergoes less physical stress thus releasing pressure from the joints.<br/><br/>
In addition to the physical benefits of swimming, lower stress levels and occurrences of depression and anxiety are known to decrease while swimming. Swimming is a meditation sport
meaning there is an increase of blood flow to the brain which allows an individual to evaluate stressors more calmly. The activity can help increase the memory for older aged
individuals who suffer from dementia.
