<i>
Boxing is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective
gloves, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a
boxing ring.
Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a
common fixture in most international games—it also has its own World
Championships. Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one- to threeminute
intervals called rounds.
The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a
referee, is disqualified for breaking a rule, or resigns by throwing in a towel. If
a fight completes all of its allocated rounds, the victor is determined by judges'
scorecards at the end of the contest. In the event that both fighters gain equal
scores from the judges, professional bouts are considered a draw. In Olympic
boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest to one
fighter on technical criteria.
While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human
history, the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the
ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC. The earliest evidence of
boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece, where boxing was established as an
Olympic game in 688 BC. Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century
prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the
mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry
Rules.

<i>
The earliest known depiction of boxing comes
from a Sumerian relief in Iraq from the 3rd
millennium BC. Later depictions from the
2nd millennium BC are found in reliefs from
the Mesopotamian nations of Assyria and
Babylonia, and in Hittite art from Asia Minor.
A relief sculpture from Egyptian Thebes (c.
1350 BC) shows both boxers and spectators.
These early Middle-Eastern and Egyptian
depictions showed contests where fighters were
either bare-fisted or had a band supporting the
wrist. The earliest evidence of fist fighting
with the use of gloves can be found on Minoan
Crete (c. 1500–1400 BC).
Various types of boxing existed in ancient
India. The earliest references to musti-yuddha come from classical Vedic epics such as the
Ramayana and Rig Veda. The Mahabharata describes two combatants boxing with
clenched fists and fighting with kicks, finger strikes, knee strikes and headbutts. Duels
(niyuddham) were often fought to the death. During the period of the Western Satraps, the
ruler Rudradaman - in addition to being well-versed in "the great sciences" which included Indian classical music,
Sanskrit grammar, and logic - was said to be an excellent horseman, charioteer, elephant rider, swordsman and boxer.
The Gurbilas Shemi, an 18th-century Sikh text, gives numerous references to musti-yuddha.

<h2 class="c"> Modern boxing</h2><hr/>
<p class="a"><i>
The sport rising from illegal venues and outlawed prize fighting has become one of the largest multibillion-dollar sports
today. A majority of young talent still comes from poverty-stricken areas around the world. Places like Mexico, Africa,
South America, and Eastern Europe prove to be filled with young aspiring athletes who wish to become the future of
boxing. Even in the U.S., places like the inner cities of New York, and Chicago have given rise to promising young talent.
According to Rubin, "boxing lost its appeal with the American middle class, and most of who boxes in modern America
come from the streets and are street fighters.

<h1 class="c b" ><b> Technique</b></h1>
<dl>
<dt> <h2 class="c" ><b>Stance</b></h2></dt>
<dd class="a"><i>
The modern boxing stance differs substantially from the typical boxing stances of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The
modern stance has a more upright vertical-armed guard, as opposed to the more horizontal, knuckles-facing-forward
guard adopted by early 20th century hook users such as Jack Johnson.</i>
</dd>

<dt><h2 class="c"><b>Puches</b></h2></dt>
<dd class="a"><i>
There are four basic punches in boxing: the jab, cross, hook and uppercut. Any punch other than a jab is considered a
power punch. If a boxer is right-handed (orthodox), his left hand is the lead hand and his right hand is the rear hand. For a
left-handed boxer or southpaw, the hand positions are reversed. For clarity, the following discussion will assume a righthanded
boxer.</i>
<ul class="c" ><b>Jab -</b><br/>
<li class="a"><i>
– A quick, straight punch thrown with the lead hand from the guard position. The jab extends from the side of the
torso and typically does not pass in front of it. It is accompanied by a small, clockwise rotation of the torso and hips,
while the fist rotates 90 degrees, becoming horizontal upon impact. As the punch reaches full extension, the lead
shoulder can be brought up to guard the chin. The rear hand remains next to the face to guard the jaw. After making
contact with the target, the lead hand is retracted quickly to resume a guard position in front of the face.</i>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="c"><b>Cross-</b><br/>
<li class="a"><i>powerful, straight punch thrown with the rear hand. From the guard position, the rear hand is thrown from
the chin, crossing the body and traveling towards the target in a straight line. The rear shoulder is thrust forward and
finishes just touching the outside of the chin. At the same time, the lead hand is retracted and tucked against the face
to protect the inside of the chin. For additional power, the torso and hips are rotated counter-clockwise as the cross is
thrown. A measure of an ideally extended cross is that the shoulder of the striking arm, the knee of the front leg and
the ball of the front foot are on the same vertical plane.

<h1 class="c  b"><b>Defence</b></h1>
<p class="a"><i>There are several basic maneuvers a boxer can use in order to evade or block punches, depicted and discussed below.</i></p><br/>
<center> <img src="boxing img3.jpg" align="middle" /><br/></center>

<h2 class="c" ><b>Slip –</b></h2><p class="a"> Slipping rotates the body slightly so that an incoming punch passes harmlessly next to the head. As the
opponent's punch arrives, the boxer sharply rotates the hips and shoulders. This turns the chin sideways and allows
the punch to "slip" past. Muhammad Ali was famous for extremely fast and close slips, as was an early Mike Tyson.</p>
<h2 class="c"><b>Sway or fade – </b></h2><p class="a">To anticipate a punch and move the upper body or head back so that it misses or has its force
appreciably lessened. Also called "rolling with the punch" or " Riding The Punch".</p>
<h2 class="c">Duck or break –</h2><p class="a"> To drop down with the back straight so that a punch aimed at the head glances or misses entirely.</p>
<h2 class="c"><b>Bob and weave –</b></h2> <p class="a">Bobbing moves the head laterally and beneath an incoming punch. As the opponent's punch
arrives, the boxer bends the legs quickly and simultaneously shifts the body either slightly right or left. Once the
punch has been evaded, the boxer "weaves" back to an upright position, emerging on either the outside or inside of
the opponent's still-extended arm. To move outside the opponent's extended arm is called "bobbing to the outside". To
move inside the opponent's extended arm is called "bobbing to the inside". Joe Frazier, Jack Dempsey, Mike Tyson
and Rocky Marciano were masters of bobbing and weaving.</p>
<h2 class="c" ><b>Parry/block -</b></h2><p class="a">Parrying or blocking uses the boxer's shoulder, hands or arms as defensive tools to protect against
incoming attacks. A block generally receives a punch while a parry tends to deflect it. A "palm", "catch", or "cuff" is a
defence which intentionally takes the incoming punch on the palm portion of the defender's glove.</p>
<h2 class="c" ><b>The cover-up –</b></h2><p class="a"> Covering up is the last opportunity (other than rolling with a punch) to avoid an incoming strike to an
unprotected face or body. Generally speaking, the hands are held high to protect the head and chin and the forearms
are tucked against the torso to impede body shots. When protecting the body, the boxer rotates the hips and lets
incoming punches "roll" off the guard. To protect the head, the boxer presses both fists against the front of the face
with the forearms parallel and facing outwards. This type of guard is weak against attacks from below.</p>
